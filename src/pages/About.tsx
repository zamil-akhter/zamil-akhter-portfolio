              I am a passionate full stack developer with almost two years of experience
              bringing ideas to life through modern, high-performance web applications.
              I love working with React.js and Next.js on the frontend, and Python, Django,
              DRF, and FastAPI on the backend to create smooth, reliable experiences.
            </p>
            <p>
              I enjoy solving problems and turning concepts into scalable, real-world
              solutions. Along the way, I have gained strong skills in AWS and API
              integrations. For me, creating software is not just coding, itâ€™s building
              meaningful digital experiences.
